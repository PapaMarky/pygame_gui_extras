class GuiApp:
    """
        Base class for creating python scripts with GUI interfaces.

        ``pygame_gui`` is a full-featured and fairly easy to use python package for adding
        Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) to python applications. There is a lot of boilerplate setup
        that is required for creating a ``pygame_gui`` based application. This class does all the setup
        for you so you can focus on your application and its interface.

        This class requires pygame and pygame_gui and is intended to simplify the process of creating
        GUI applications using those packages.

        Being familiar with pygame will be helpful. Learning
        the basics of pygame_gui is essential because to create anything useful you will want to
        add your own UI elements.

        How To Use This Class
        =====================
        The best way to use this class is to derive your own App class from it and override these functions to
        implement your own application:

        * setup: to add UI elements to the root window and do any other application
          initialization. See :func: `setup`
        * update: to update application data. Called from the `main_loop`
          See :func: `update`
        * handle_events: to handle UI and custom events. Called from the `main_loop`

        This design lets you focus on the parts of your application that are
        different from other applications and takes care of the basic framework of the
        graphical user interface.

        How This Class Works
        ====================
        The basic workflow is
            * setup the objects and user interface of the applications
            * then update objects and handle events in a loop.

        Assuming you have created a subclass `MyAppClass` that overrides `setup`, `update` and
        `handle_event`, the program to use it should look something like this::

            app = MyAppClass()
            app.setup()
            app.run()

    def __init__(self, window_size, framerate: int = 60, title: str = None, resizeable=True):
